## Getting Started

To get started with these labs, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided in each lab's directory. Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed, such as a C++ compiler, OpenGL, GLFW, GLAD, and GLM.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishak96/ComputerGraphics.git
cd ComputerGraphics
```

## Getting Started with VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Navigate to the specific lab folder that you want to work on within the VS Code file explorer.
3. Update the compiler location with your `g++` compiler path in the following files:
  - `.vscode/launch.json`
  - `.vscode/tasks.json`
4. Run the Lab:
  - Go to the VS Code menu.
  - Select `Run`.
  - Choose `Run Without Debugging`.
